# CQRS and MediatR — My Notes

**Phase:** 2
**Status:** [ ] To write

---

## What is CQRS? (in my own words)

> Explain the Command/Query separation in plain language.

---

## What is MediatR doing exactly?

> What is the "mediator pattern"? How does MediatR route a command to its handler?

---

## The pipeline — what happens before the handler runs?

> List the behaviors in order and what each one does.

4.

---

## Before vs after CQRS

> How would CreateTask look as a service method vs as a command/handler?
> Write both versions and explain the difference.

**Before (service):**
```csharp
// Write the service approach here
```

**After (CQRS):**
```csharp
// Write the command + handler approach here
```

## What was confusing at first?

---

## How I would explain it in an interview

---

## Code example from this project

```csharp
// Paste CreateTaskCommand.cs and CreateTaskCommandHandler.cs here
```
