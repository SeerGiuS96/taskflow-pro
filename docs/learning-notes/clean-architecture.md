# Clean Architecture — My Notes

**Phase:** 1
**Status:** [ ] To write

---

## What is it? (in my own words)

> Write here after implementing Phase 1.
> Explain it as if talking to a colleague who hasn't heard of it.

---

## Why did we use it in this project?

> What problem does it solve that I actually experienced while coding?

---

## The dependency rule — what does it mean in practice?

> Give a concrete example from this codebase.
> For example: "Domain.Task.cs has no `using` statement that references EF Core. This means..."

---

## What goes in each layer?

| Layer | What I put there | What I was tempted to put there but shouldn't |
|---|---|---|
| Domain | | |
| Application | | |
| Infrastructure | | |
| API | | |

---

## What was confusing at first?

> Write what confused you and how you resolved it.

---

## How I would explain it in an interview

> Write your answer to: "Can you explain the Clean Architecture you used in your project?"
> Keep it under 90 seconds spoken.

---

## Code example from this project

```csharp
// Paste a real example here once implemented
// e.g. show how Task.cs (Domain) has no EF Core references
```
