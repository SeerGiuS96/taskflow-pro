## What is Docker? (in my own words)

> Not the marketing definition. What does it actually do?
> What is a "container" vs a "virtual machine"?

---

## What is a Docker image vs a container?

> Analogy: image is like _____, container is like _____.

---

## What is Docker Compose?

> Why do we need Docker Compose if we already have Docker?

---

## The commands I use most

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose up -d` | |
| `docker-compose down` | |
| `docker-compose down -v` | |
| `docker-compose logs -f api` | |
| `docker ps` | |

## What is a multi-stage Dockerfile?

> Why do we build in one stage and run in another?
> What is the size difference in practice?

---

## What is a volume?

> Why do we use volumes for PostgreSQL data?
> What happens if we don't?

---

## What was confusing at first?

## How I would explain it in an interview
