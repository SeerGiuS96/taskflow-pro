# Learning Notes

These notes are written **by me, in my own words**, as I build the project.
Writing concepts in your own words is the most effective way to retain them.

## How to use these notes

- Each file covers one concept
- Written while implementing that concept — not copied from docs
- Includes examples from this codebase, not generic tutorials
- Review them before interviews
